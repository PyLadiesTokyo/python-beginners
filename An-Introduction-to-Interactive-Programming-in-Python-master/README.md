This is a collection of python gaming projects that I made under an online course named "An Introduction to Interactive Programming in Python"

Project 1: ROCK, PAPER AND SCISSORS

In this game, player and computer play rock, paper and scissors for 5 times. We can see the result of all the games. 

Project 2: GUESS THE NUMBER 
http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_QGeR2DHm8o_0.py
In this game, the program chooses a random number within the range of [0,100] or [0,1000] and the player needs to guess that number. With every guess, player gets a reply telling him/her that whether the guess was right. If the guess was wrong, he/she gets another message telling him/her that next time, he /she should trier higher/lower. 

Project 3: PINGPONG
http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user39_ekiBY3Kkgq_0.py
It's a basic version of a pingpong game. The game needs two players. The left-hand side player uses 'w' and 's' keys to move his/her paddle whereas the right-hand side moves 'up' and 'down' arrow keys to do the same. 

Project 4: MEMORY 
http://www.codeskulptor.org/#user38_lqfvHRbI56_4.py
In this game, the player sees 16 blocks under which 16 numbers [0,7] are hidden. He/she can open two block at one time. If the numbers are same, then the blocks remain open. If the numbers are not same, the blocks closes again. 
The player's goal is to open all the blocks. 

Project 5: BLACKJACK
